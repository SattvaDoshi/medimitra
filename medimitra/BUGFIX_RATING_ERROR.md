# React Error Fix: PharmacyLocator Rating Display

## Problem
The PharmacyLocator component was throwing a React error:
```
Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {average, count})
```

## Root Cause
The `pharmacy.rating` property from the backend API was returning an object with structure:
```javascript
{
  average: 4.5,
  count: 98
}
```

But the component was trying to render this object directly in JSX, which React doesn't allow.

## Solution

### 1. Updated TypeScript Interface
Updated the `Pharmacy` interface in `pharmacyApi.ts` to properly type the rating field:
```typescript
rating: number | { average: number; count: number } | null;
```

### 2. Created Helper Function
Added a `formatRating` function to safely extract display values:
```typescript
const formatRating = (rating: number | { average: number; count: number } | null): { display: string; count?: number } => {
  if (!rating) return { display: 'N/A' };
  
  if (typeof rating === 'object') {
    return {
      display: rating.average?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A',
      count: rating.count
    };
  }
  
  return { display: rating.toString() };
};
```

### 3. Fixed JSX Rendering
Updated the component to use the helper function:
```tsx
const ratingInfo = formatRating(pharmacy.rating);

// In JSX:
<span className="text-sm font-medium">
  {ratingInfo.display}
</span>
{ratingInfo.count && (
  <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    ({ratingInfo.count} reviews)
  </span>
)}
```

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error messages for pharmacy search
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved user feedback for empty search results

### Error Boundary Component
Created a reusable `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle React errors gracefully.

## Testing
✅ Backend API working correctly (tested via curl)
✅ Pharmacy search by city returning data
✅ Rating display now works for both object and number formats
✅ No more React rendering errors

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/pharmacyApi.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces
2. `src/pages/PharmacyLocator.tsx` - Fixed rating display and added error handling
3. `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - New error boundary component

The error has been resolved and the pharmacy locator should now work properly when searching by city.
